         <p>My name is Nicholas Kurgan, Im 20 and doing a computor science degree at URI. I am now  ajunior and so far I have been loving this class<br>
             Im diabetic and have been for about 15 years or so, honestly I dont keep good track anymore but thats whatever. <br>
        I live on a pond in Coventry RI which is going through an environmental disaster caused by a man named Doug Socia (go look him up).<br>
        I do 3d printing as a hobby and have done it since highschool, I own an ender 3, and have made numerous thingamabobs and whatchamacallits using it.<br>
        Ill put in some pictures of my cat and printer into the webpage so you can see them.<br>
